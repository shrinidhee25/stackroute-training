1.Does JavaScript pass parameter by value or by reference?
In JavaScript, primitive types (such as numbers, strings, booleans) are passed by value, 
while objects (including arrays and functions) are passed by reference.




2.What is the difference between “undefined” and “not defined” in JavaScript?
The value "undefined" represents the absence of a value or the lack of an assigned value.
It is a special value in JavaScript that is automatically assigned to variables that are declared but not assigned a value.
It can also be explicitly assigned to a variable or returned from a function when no value is specified.

"Not defined" refers to a variable or identifier that has not been declared or is not accessible within the current scope.
It occurs when you try to use a variable or access a property that has not been declared or is out of scope.




3. Predict the output and explain.
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	(function(x) {
    	setTimeout(function() { console.log(x); },  1000 );
    })(i);
}

the output will be
0
1
2
3
4



4. What will be the output? Explain

var x= 5;
function check(){
  y = 10;
  console.log(x);
  var x =10;
}
function check2(){  
  console.log(y);
}
check();
check2();



the output will be
undefined
10
